A light version of scapy in c.  for windows only I quickly made during a penetration test.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

the winpcap library should be installed in the project.
try these manuals:
      https://www.winpcap.org/docs/docs_412/html/group__compilation.html
  or 
      https://youtu.be/YpnrR7D_lRI  (it's not a fishing...just search for C++ & PCAP Files made by NYUCyFor in youtube =])
      
  
  
### Installing

1.  download the code from the repo.
2.  pay attention to the packet.txt file. put your data in there and don't forget to put a blank line in the end of the file.
3.  compile the code.

** pay attention to the dissector i have added to the repo in oder to sniff the packet.
